Book Exchange Hub
As a student, I developed an Android application for an online book marketplace using Firebase and Android Studio. The app provides a secure platform for buying and selling books, featuring a user-friendly login system, detailed book listings, and personalized profiles. Users can easily manage their book inventory, and administrators have the capability to oversee accounts and listings. This project showcases my skills in Android development, Firebase integration, and user interface design,where whatsapp and google pay api are used to contact admin and pay via gpay
